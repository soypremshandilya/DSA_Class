# DSA Classroom Codes and Practices

Welcome to the **DSA_Class** repository! This repository contains a collection of code examples and practice exercises related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) taught in class and developed during personal practice.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `class_codes/` - Code examples from classroom lectures.
- `practice_codes/` - Personal practice solutions and additional exercises.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-classroom.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd dsa-classroom
    ```

3. **Explore the Code:**
